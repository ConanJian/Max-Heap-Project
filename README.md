This is the other project on my resume.
This project came from my CS2400 class at Cal Poly Pomona.

What I did:
I created a max heap using an Array of Integers obtained from a file
and outputted my result as a textfile.

Notes: I didn't pay much attention to the security becuase it wasn't required
None of the code has been altered. It is the exact same code I turned in.
